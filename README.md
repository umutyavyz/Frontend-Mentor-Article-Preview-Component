# Frontend Mentor - Article Preview Component

This is my solution to the [Article Preview Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT).  
It was built using **HTML5**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal was to create a responsive article preview component with an interactive share functionality that adapts beautifully between desktop and mobile devices.
